              <p> <b>From Databases to Data Science: impact on information systems</b>
              <br>
              Patrick Valduriez</p>

              <p><u>Abstract:</u> Data has been quoted as the new oil, to reflect that big data can be turned into high-value information and new knowledge. Although data analysis has been around for a while, starting with statistics and evolving lately into exploratory data analysis, data mining and business intelligence, the new dimensions of big data (volume, variety, velocity, etc.) make it very hard to process and analyze data online, and derive good conclusions. In particular, relational DBMSs, which are at the heart of any information system, have been lately criticized for their “one size fits all” approach. Although they have been able to integrate support for all kinds of data (e.g., multimedia objects, XML and JSON documents and new functions), this has resulted in a loss of performance and flexibility for new data-intensive applications. To address this grand challenge, data science is emerging as a new science that combines data management, statistics and machine learning, visualization and human-computer interactions to collect, clean, integrate, analyze and visualize big data. The ultimate goal is to create new data products and services, as well as training legions of data scientists. In this talk, I will introduce data science, in relation to databases, and discuss its impact on information systems. I will also illustrate the main opportunities and risks, in particular by telling my favorite stories about the good, the bad and the ugly.

              <p><u>Abstract:</u> I will first present some of the research activity carried out at the Artificial Intelligence laboratory of Facebook, namely FAIR. Our research covers very different topics, such as computer vision, natural language processing, reasoning, optimization and large-scale processing. I will then present a specific work on similarity search, namely Polysemous codes (joint work with Matthijs Douze and Florent Perronnin). It addresses the problem of efficiently searching in a billion-sized collections of high-dimensional vectors, representing for instance images. I will conclude by a discussion comparing my experience of research in academia and at Facebook.

              </center>
              <p><u>Abstract:</u> Many large networks are formed by dynamic growth that can be modelled by simple random mechanisms. A natural problem is to discover the "past" of such networks by merely observing their present state. This talk addresses one of the simplest such problems one may formulate: find the the first vertex in large random trees generated by either the uniform attachment or preferential attachment model. We study algorithms that, upon observing the tree, output a set of K vertices. We require that, with probability at least 1 – ε, the first vertex is in this set. We show that for any ε, there exist such algorithms with K independent of the size of the tree.
              <br>
              The talk is based on joint work with Seb Bubeck and Luc Devroye.
